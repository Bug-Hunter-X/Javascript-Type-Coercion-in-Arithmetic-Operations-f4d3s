This example demonstrates a common Javascript bug stemming from type coercion with the + operator. When adding a number and a string, Javascript concatenates them instead of performing numerical addition. This can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug errors in larger programs. The solution involves strict type checking or using the Number() function for explicit type conversion.
